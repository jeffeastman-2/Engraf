Layer 3 Spatial Validation Test

This test demonstrates Layer 3's true purpose: validating which spatial attention
relationships are valid based on current scene state and resolving complex
PP attention chains.

Layer 3 Architecture:
- Input: Complex PP chains with resolved SceneObjectPhrases
- Process: Validate spatial relationships and resolve attention combinatorics
- Output: Valid spatial attention chains with rejected invalid relationships

Test sentence: "move the box above the table beside the pyramid under the sphere to [3,4,5]"
Expected Layer 2 output: SO PPSO PPSO PPSO PP (box, table, pyramid, sphere, [3,4,5])
Layer 3 job: Determine which PPSO attends to which SO/PPSO based on scene validity
